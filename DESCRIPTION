Description: Software for video densitometry analysis. The software takes one chromatogram image, dimension parameters from the sample and development steps and extract the video densitograms. Then a step of preprocessing is made (baseline correction but more eventually like peak alignment, smoothing etc...), followed by a step of peak integration. Finally, a linear or quadratic model is fit which give access to LOD, LOQ, R2, RMSE and allow to predict new samples.
